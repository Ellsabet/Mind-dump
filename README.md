# Mind-dump
My head is always filled with a plethora of opposing forces of optimism and cynicism.
This project was inspired by a friend of mine who wrote something very similar. Upon observing their work, I was struck with the idea
of doing a similar layout, and just letting it be a complete dump for all the things positive and negative that fly across my mind constantly.
I think this is a good representation of me fighting myself internally. Everyone has an inner cynist. My inner optimist is insistant on countering those negative thought streams with constant reminders that overall, I'm okay. I'm alive. I enjoy my life. The world isn't half as bad as we paint it to be.
